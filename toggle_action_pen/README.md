# Toggle Action Pen

Simple pen with minimal number of moving parts for Parker style ballpoint refills.

## Printing

Recommended settings: 4 vertical perimeters, 50% infill (there are very few places thick enough for infill), seam position: random. Brim for tip and barrel.

Mechanism usually requires some break in to start moving easily.
