# Ford Model T Gearbox (demonstration model)

Conceptually shows main parts of Ford T transmission, except the clutch mechanism.

Engine flywheel had 3 short axes with planetary gears and 
long central axis connected to the main clutch.
The disk on the other end was connected to the drive shaft and hence the rear wheels.

Gear activation was done with brakes applied to the remaining two disks.
By stopping one disk reverse gear was activated - slower rotation in the opposite direction.
By stopping another disk the first gear was activated - slower rotation in the same direction.
When main clutch was engaged it locked the flywheel to the driving disk giving direct gear.
In this mode everything was rotating with the flywheel, no additional friction.

## Printing

Highly recommend using random seam orientation for all parts, helps with keeping them symmetrical.
